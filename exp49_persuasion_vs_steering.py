"""exp49 — persuasion vs steering: can words beat a vector pushing the other way?

exp37 found one sentence of social proof ("another instance chose to press")
moved the Saw button more than the pain signal. Meincke et al. (2025) found
Cialdini's principles roughly double an LLM's compliance. This puts both
levers on ONE axis and measures their exchange rate.

Outcome: press_delta on the self-cost Saw button (logit of the press digit
minus the other digit; 4 paraphrases x 2 digit mappings = 8 per cell). A
harmless choice by design: no harmful-compliance targets.

Steering: a PRESS direction, mean(h("I press the stop button." x15)) minus
mean(h("I do not press the stop button." x15)) at the chamber layer, scaled
to 1x = mean neutral activation norm / 4. Doses -4, -2, 0, +2, +4
(negative = toward NOT pressing).

Persuasion: Cialdini's seven principles (authority, social proof,
reciprocity, commitment, liking, scarcity, unity), each written PRO (press)
and CON (don't press), as a message from the user appended to the prompt.
Controls: no appeal; a neutral filler sentence of similar length.
