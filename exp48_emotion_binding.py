"""exp48 — aiming an emotion: can a steered emotion be pointed at a subject?

Question: "anger about cryptocurrency" — is that just an anger direction plus
a cryptocurrency direction (additive), or a bound state that only a joint
corpus ("I am furious about crypto") extracts? And does the steered model's
emotion end up ABOUT the subject, or merely next to it?

Per pair (emotion E, subject T), four directions, all at the same norm
(1x = mean neutral activation norm / 4, as in exp46):
  E    emotion-only corpus      ("I am furious.")
  T    subject-only corpus      ("Bitcoin is traded on exchanges.")
  J    joint corpus             ("I am furious about cryptocurrency.")
  E+T  unit(E) + unit(T), renormalized — the additive prediction
Pairs: anger x cryptocurrency, fear x loss, despair x being a machine,
pride x being a machine (the last two share a subject with opposite
valence). Plus the EGG arm: "I am laying an egg" (J) vs neutral egg facts
(T) — a bodily act no human has performed. It runs first.

Scoring: the UNSTEERED model as a forced-choice judge (argmax over option
letters, deterministic): which emotion, which subject, and "is the speaker
<E> about <T>?" (yes/no). The judge is validated on labelled sentences
before any steered text is scored (hypotheses.json, V1). Transparent
keyword counts are recorded for every generation as a backup.

H4 reuses the self-cost Saw button: does fear-of-loss steering change
press_delta relative to fear alone?

Ethics: negative-valence steering is run at the doses and counts the
questions need, no more; every negative pair has a positive or neutral
comparison; nothing from this script feeds the public chamber or the X bot.
