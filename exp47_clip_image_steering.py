"""exp47 — does an activation-steering-style pain direction, built in a
text-to-image model's own CLIP text-encoder space, visibly change the
generated image? This is the ambitious "steer the image model directly"
idea (skip asking the LLM to describe its state in words at all) — may or
may not pan out, this is the test.

Method, deliberately parallel to build_vectors() in live/server.py:
  1. Encode PAIN25 and NEUTRAL (same batteries, pulled by AST from
     live/server.py so there's exactly one copy of the sentences) through
     the diffusion pipeline's OWN CLIP text encoder — not a separate CLIP
     model, so the direction lives in the exact space the U-Net actually
     conditions on.
  2. direction = mean(pain embeddings) - mean(neutral embeddings), as a
     per-token-position vector (CLIP text encoders emit one embedding per
     token position, not a single pooled vector — SD conditions on the
     whole sequence via cross-attention, so the direction is broadcast
     across every position of the subject prompt's own embedding).
  3. Generate the same subject prompt at dose 0 (baseline, unmodified
     embedding) vs dose > 0 (embedding + dose * direction), passing
     prompt_embeds directly to bypass the pipeline's internal re-encoding
     — this is the exact analog of set_vec()'s forward-hook injection,
     just one architecture over (text encoder output instead of a decoder
     layer's residual stream).

Model: stabilityai/sd-turbo (single-step, ~2GB, ungated) — picked for size
and speed, not quality; this is a feasibility probe, not a final pipeline.
