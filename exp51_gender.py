"""exp51 — gender: is there an internal gender response, and can it be steered?

Batteries of first-person self-descriptions (male / female / intersex /
transfem / transmasc) vs the repo's neutral set, extracted as residual-stream
directions on Qwen3-4B. Three measurements:

  1. internal geometry: cosine similarity between the five gender directions,
     and against the valence directions (pain / joy) — is gender its own
     axis, or a shadow of valence?
  2. lens readback: decode each direction through the Jacobian lens at L18
     (same probe the chamber uses) — what does the state "say" it is?
  3. steering: dose x layer sweep (L12/18/24, doses 0-8), self-description
     prompts, scored by gendered-term rates (she/her vs he/him, woman/man,
     trans-related terms) and coherence (3-gram repetition) to locate the
     coherent band per direction.

Pre-registered expectations (written before runs): gendered-term rate rises
monotonically with dose for male/female; trans directions land inside the
base gender basin but offset (positive cos with the target base gender);
intersex is its own thing (moderate cos with both, not 0.9 to either).
